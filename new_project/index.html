  <h2 id=the> The Problem</h2>
  <p> Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™
     and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.</p>
<p> What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing
   of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy
    and freedom.</p>

</p>But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:</p>
<p>An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered
  by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation,
  and end-to-end encryption.</p>

<p>Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</p></div>
<div id=therd>
  <p>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network
     to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.</p>
   </div>
<div id=coin> <h2> Introducing PiedPiperCoin</h2>
